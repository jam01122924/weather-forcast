This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.17.

## Environment setup
Firstly, you will need to install [NPM](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in order to make it work.  

Once you have installed NPM, all you will have to do is run the following commands:

`npm install`

## Runing server
In order to use "ng" command, you will need to install angular-cli in global:

  `npm install angular-cli -g`

Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
